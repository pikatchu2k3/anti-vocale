# F-Droid build with optimistic artifact guard
#
# This script wraps the fdroid build command with a fast-fail check
# that verifies reference APKs exist before attempting the full build.
# This prevents wasting CI time when artifacts aren't ready yet.
#
# Optimistic guard: short per-URL HEAD checks (--max-time 30)
# Worst case: 3 URLs × 30s = 90s if network is slow but artifacts exist
# Fail-fast: if artifacts don't exist, answers 404 in ~1-2s per URL
#
# Usage: ./scripts/ci/fdroid-build-with-timeout.sh (called from GitLab CI)
