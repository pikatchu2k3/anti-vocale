# One-command F-Droid reference flow, split in two phases around the ~3h
# build (the sherpa source compile for 3 ABIs measured 3h02m on v1.12.0 and
# 3h20m on v1.12.1; the old 25-50 min figures were stale). Every phase
# boundary is a gate that already exists as a script; this orchestrator only
# chains them and stops at the first red (exit nonzero).
#
#   prepare   mirror sync (fetches the fork; gate A validates local state) ->
#             gate A (pre-dispatch checker) -> stale-asset cleanup -> dispatch
#   finalize  gate C (job success, signed URLs, fork==mirror, clean tree) ->
#             fork push if local recipe commits are pending -> pipeline status
#             for THIS recipe SHA (+ retry if a write token is configured)
#
# Usage: scripts/release-fdroid-references.sh {prepare|finalize} vX.Y.Z [commit]
#   prepare vX.Y.Z <sha>   BUILD-FIRST (TASK-446, the default flow): dispatch
#                          `-f commit=<sha>` before any tag exists; the run
#                          uploads every release asset as artifacts. Afterwards
#                          scripts/release-create.sh vX.Y.Z <run-id> makes tag +
#                          release + binaries public in one act, then finalize.
#   prepare vX.Y.Z         LEGACY tag flow: dispatch `-f tag=vX.Y.Z` (the
#                          workflow creates the release itself). Kept as the
#                          fallback; the checkupdates bot can race it.
# Env:
#   DRY_RUN=1            print the side-effecting actions instead of running
#                        (exported to the sync script: its dry run is real too)
#   GL_TOKEN_WRITE=path  token file with Pipeline:Update scope; enables the
#                        GitLab retry. Without it the script prints the retry
#                        button URL and exits nonzero on a red pipeline.
#
# Why each gate (2026-08-31, all paid for once):
#   mirror     the workflow clones the MIRROR, not the fork; a mirror one
#              commit behind builds the wrong recipe
#   gate A     dispatching against a workflow whose NDK map lived only in the
#              working tree; the checker reads origin/main
#   cleanup    stale signed APKs left on the release become F-Droid's
#              binary: targets if anything reuses them
#   gate C     pushing the fork before the reference build finished is the
#              race that 404'd the fdroiddata pipeline
#   sha poll   a per-branch poll reads the PREVIOUS release's pipeline on a
#              long-lived recipe branch; the sha filter pins this release
