# Pre-flight: Verify GitHub workflow completed before pushing recipe
#
# This script MUST be run before pushing the F-Droid recipe to prevent
# the race condition where GitLab CI tries to download artifacts that
# don't exist yet (incident 2026-08-31).
#
# Checks performed:
#   1. GitHub workflow android-release.yml completed successfully
#   2. The "reproducible" job succeeded (it reads the MIRROR recipe)
#   3. All three signed APKs (app-fdroid-<abi>-release.apk) exist in the release
#   4. The mirror recipe matches the fork recipe (drift = stale builds)
#   5. origin's recipe adds nothing the local recipe lacks (the finalize
#      force-push discards nothing)
#
# Usage: ./scripts/verify-github-workflow-before-recipe-push.sh [TAG]
#   TAG: optional (defaults to CurrentVersion in the fork recipe)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = all checks passed, safe to push recipe
#   1 = checks failed (actionable message printed)
