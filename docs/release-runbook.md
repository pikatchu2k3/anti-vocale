# Coordinated Release Runbook (F-Droid + Play Store)

End-to-end procedure for shipping a new Anti-Vocale version to both stores in
sync, so that when the F-Droid MR is approved the new version is already online.

**First formalized for v1.9.0** (2026-08-01). Each step lists the mechanical
proof required before it is considered done.

## Prerequisites

- Working tree on `main`, clean or with only intended changes committed.
- `keystore.properties` present locally (release signing key).
- GitLab token at `~/.config/gl-token` (F-Droid MR polling; Pipeline:Read + MR read).
- F-Droid data fork checked out at `~/data/repo/personal/fdroid-data`, on the current recipe branch (`anti-vocale-1.10.0` as of v1.11.0; check `git branch --show-current` there).

## The two stores, and what must stay in sync

| Concern | F-Droid | Play Store |
|---|---|---|
| Source commit | same tag | same tag |
| versionName / versionCode | per-ABI codes (base*10+abi) | base versionCode |
| Timing | when MR approved | independent |
| Artifact | unsigned APK (F-Droid resigns) | signed AAB |

Only the **version number and commit** must match. The two stores can be
published at different times; there is no hard coupling. The one hard
dependency: the F-Droid recipe `binary:` URLs must resolve (HTTP 200) **before**
the recipe is pushed to the fork, otherwise the F-Droid pipeline fails.

## Step 1. Version bump (in the app repo)

In `app/build.gradle.kts`:
- `versionCode = N` (base; Play Store uses this directly).
- `versionName = "X.Y.Z"`.
- The per-ABI mapping in `androidComponents.onVariants` derives `base*10 + abiCode`
  (1=armeabi-v7a, 2=arm64-v8a, 4=x86_64). No hardcoding; a version bump does not
  require editing the mapping. But update the `?: N` fallback literal so a fresh
  sync still resolves the base code.

Proof: `./gradlew :app:assembleFdroidDebug` succeeds; the per-ABI APKs report the
expected versionCodes in their filenames.

## Step 2. Release notes + changelogs

Three audiences, three artifacts (learned shipping v1.11.0):
1. **Play what's-new**: all sections of `docs/play-store/release-notes.xml` FIRST, then `scripts/extract-release-notes.py --output-dir /tmp/whatsnew` (enforces <=490 chars per locale; uk-UA is NOT supported by the console form, keep it out). The publish workflow reads the XML; forgetting to add the version ships the PREVIOUS notes. If notes are edited after publishing, paste manually in the console (re-publishing creates a new release).
2. **GitHub release body**: two sections, "For everyone" (user-facing bullets, measurements) and "For developers" (families, policies, docs pointers, closed-issue list). Diff vs the PREVIOUS TAG, not the rc.
3. **Fastlane changelogs** (`fastlane/metadata/android/<locale>/changelogs/<code>.txt`): F-Droid new-version notes, one file per locale directory that exists, named after the **base** versionCode.

Proof: the XML contains the new version in every locale section; the extractor runs green; the changelog files exist and reference the correct versionCode.

## Step 3. Commit and push main (build-first: NO tag here)

The tag is created LATER, by Step 5b's publish act, together with the release
and all binaries. Until then no tag exists, so the fdroid checkupdates bot
(`UpdateCheckMode: Tags`) cannot see the version at all; when the tag appears,
every `binary:` URL already resolves. This ordering replaced the old
tag-then-build flow, which the bot's sweep could race (2026-09-04: bot MR at
06:23 UTC, signed APKs attached ~07:20, pipeline 404).

```bash
git commit -m "release: vX.Y.Z (versionCode N) - <summary>"
git push origin main
SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)   # the bump commit: recipe, dispatch and tag all anchor here
```

Proof: `git ls-remote origin main` shows origin/main at `$SHA`; `git ls-remote --tags origin | grep -c vX.Y.Z` prints 0 (the tag must NOT exist yet).

## Step 4. Update the F-Droid recipe (BEFORE building references)

The `reproducible-fdroid` job clones the recipe **from the mirror**
(`paoloantinori/fdroid-data-mirror`, branch `av1100-slim`) and builds whatever
`commit:` it points to. Therefore the MIRROR must be pushed before the
reference build runs. The FORK push comes later, after Step 6's gate: the fork
push is what triggers the fdroiddata pipeline, and that pipeline must not
start until the signed reference APKs exist (the 2026-08-31 race).

```bash
cd ~/data/repo/personal/fdroid-data
# FIRST sync the recipe branch from upstream master (research 2026-09-01:
# fdroiddata accepts per-app or per-version branch names, but the MR diffs
# against master, and master keeps moving via rewritemeta and bot merges; a
# branch left at the previous merge shows reversions in the MR diff. The
# recipe file itself is normally identical to master right after a merge, so
# the reset discards nothing):
git fetch upstream master
git diff HEAD upstream/master -- metadata/com.antivocale.app.yml   # expect empty
git reset --hard upstream/master
# Generate the three per-ABI blocks with the repo script (NEVER hand-append:
# the 2026-08-30 hand edit landed the blocks inside VercodeOperation's list
# and cost three failed reference builds). BUILD-FIRST: pass the bump commit
# explicitly (--commit); the default peels the tag from origin, and no tag
# exists yet.
cd ~/data/repo/personal/anti-vocale
python3 scripts/new-fdroid-version.py \
  --recipe ~/data/repo/personal/fdroid-data/metadata/com.antivocale.app.yml \
  --commit "$SHA" --write
cd - && git diff metadata/com.antivocale.app.yml   # review the generated blocks
```

**Cross-check BEFORE pushing anywhere (TASK-420):** run
`SKIP_BINARY_URLS=1 EXPECT_COMMIT="$SHA" scripts/check-fdroid-release.sh vX.Y.Z`
from the repo root and require
ALL CHECKS PASSED. It pins the invariants that drifted silently on 2026-08-31
(stale sherpa srclib pin cloned from the old blocks: 1.13.4 in the recipe vs
1.13.5 in the app; issue #38) and rejects consecutive blank lines, the
formatting class that made the fork CI's `fdroid rewritemeta` job red on
1.11.1 (a generator join bug fixed 2026-09-01). SKIP_BINARY_URLS=1 because on a fresh release the
signed assets only exist after step 5b's publish act; the FULL checker (URLs included,
no env var) is the post-build, pre-bot-MR gate. If the pin check fails, the
generator should already have synced it: a failure means the recipe was edited by
hand, fix the blocks and re-run.

Run `/simplify` and `/code-review high` on the diff before pushing. Check:
- Three versionName/versionCode blocks; the commit SHA matches the tag.
- `binary:` is a multi-line block (trailing space after the key, URL on next line).
- `CurrentVersion` / `CurrentVersionCode` updated (CurrentVersionCode = the MAX per-ABI code).
- No stale `fix-pg-map-id` or other postbuild experiments left over.

**VersionCode consistency check (mandatory).** The app derives per-ABI codes as
`base*10 + abi` (1=armeabi-v7a, 2=arm64-v8a, 4=x86_64). The recipe hardcodes all
three plus `CurrentVersionCode`. A transposed digit would silently mispublish an
ABI. Verify before every push:

```bash
base=$(grep -m1 'versionCode = ' app/build.gradle.kts | grep -oE '[0-9]+')
echo "armeabi-v7a=$((base*10+1)) arm64-v8a=$((base*10+2)) x86_64=$((base*10+4))"
# CurrentVersionCode must == base*10+4 (the MAX/x86_64 code; fdroiddata convention, licaon-corrected on MR 47391).
```

Then commit (do NOT push the fork yet; Step 6 gates the push):

```bash
git add metadata/com.antivocale.app.yml
git commit -m "Update to vX.Y.Z (versionCode ABC/ABD/ABF): <summary>"
# NO fork push here: the fork push triggers the fdroiddata pipeline, which
# 404s until the signed reference APKs exist. Push after Step 6's gate.
# INVARIANT (2026-09-01 incident): the fork remote is written ONLY at finalize
# (Step 6), with --force-with-lease. prepare and sync-fdroid-mirror never touch
# it; a manual reconciliation push mid-flow is what started the doomed 404
# pipeline. The branch is reset onto fdroid/master each release, so the
# finalize push is non-FF BY DESIGN; the lease plus the recipe-content guard in
# the script keep a maintainer's suggestion commits (!47391-style) safe.
# On a fresh fork clone, install the pre-push hook (backup + shim; exact
# commands in the header of scripts/fdroid-recipe-pre-push.sh): it refuses ANY
# push of a recipe-carrying branch until the signed APK URLs resolve, so the
# premature-push class cannot recur even by hand.
```

**THEN the mirror (the step the workflow actually reads):** the reproducible
job clones the GitHub mirror `paoloantinori/fdroid-data-mirror`, branch
`av1100-slim`, NOT this fork. Pushing only the fork fails the recipe-commit
guard (2026-08-30, twice). The sync requires the COMMIT above (it stamps the
mirror commit with the fork SHA that must contain the synced content):

```bash
cd ~/data/repo/personal/anti-vocale
scripts/sync-fdroid-mirror.sh
# cp + commit + push of the recipe to the mirror (branch av1100-slim). Fails
# loudly on an uncommitted fork recipe, a diverged checkout, or a mirror not
# on av1100-slim; verifies the remote branch matches before declaring sync.
# DRY_RUN=1 prints the actions instead (fetches, guard and diff still run).
```

## Step 5. Build reference APKs (reproducible F-Droid, pre-tag dispatch)

Dispatch the workflow with the bump COMMIT (no tag exists yet). The job clones
the mirror recipe (which points at that commit), builds, signs, and uploads
every release asset as workflow ARTIFACTS; nothing is published.

```
gh workflow run android-release.yml -f commit=$SHA
```

One command chains the whole pre-build half: gate A (the SKIP_BINARY_URLS=1
checker in EXPECT_COMMIT mode), the mirror sync above, the stale-asset cleanup
below (a no-op while the release does not exist), and this dispatch:

```
scripts/release-fdroid-references.sh prepare vX.Y.Z $SHA
```

A built-in guard step fails the job fast if the recipe's `commit:` does not match
the dispatched SHA, so a stale-recipe reference cannot ship silently.

**Stale-asset rule:** before ANY re-dispatch after publishing, DELETE the
canonical `app-fdroid-*` release assets (signed + unsigned): the workflow's
uploads are the `binary:` targets, and whatever is attached when the recipe
pushes is what F-Droid ships. The script cannot tell a "right" prior asset
from a wrong one, so the cleanup is unconditional; `prepare` does it
automatically (pattern-matched against the live asset list).

Two jobs:
1. `Build` assembles the unsigned APKs (artifact `app-fdroid-release`) and the
   tester APKs (artifact `tester-apks`).
2. `reproducible-fdroid` rebuilds inside the F-Droid buildserver image, signs the
   three per-ABI APKs with `apksigner` (v2/v3 only, `--alignment-preserved`),
   and uploads them as the `fdroid-signed-references` artifact.

This is the slowest step: sherpa-onnx is compiled from source for 3 ABIs (~25-40 min).

Proof: `gh run view <id> --json jobs` shows `reproducible-fdroid` = success and
the three artifacts present; NOTE the run id (`gh run list --event
workflow_dispatch --limit 1`) for Step 5b. `gh release view vX.Y.Z` still 404s:
nothing is public yet.

## Step 5b. Publish: tag + release + all binaries in one act

`scripts/release-create.sh` downloads the three artifacts, verifies the 12-file
set, and creates the tag, the release, and every asset with ONE `gh release
create`. That single command is the moment the version becomes public; from it
on, the recipe's `binary:` URLs all resolve, so the checkupdates bot cannot hit
a partial release whatever its schedule.

```
scripts/release-create.sh vX.Y.Z --run-id <id> --commit $SHA --notes-file <github-body.md>
```

`--notes-file` is the curated GitHub release body from Step 2.2 saved to a file.

Proof: the script's post-checks pass (tag at `$SHA`, 12 assets). `gh release
view vX.Y.Z --json assets --jq '.assets[].name'` lists the three **signed** (no
`-unsigned`) APKs among them. If `gh release create` dies mid-upload the post
checks fail loudly; finish with `gh release upload vX.Y.Z <remaining files>`
(the release is public but partial until then, so act quickly).

LEGACY fallback (`-f tag=` dispatch, the workflow creates the release itself):
still supported by `prepare vX.Y.Z` without the commit arg; do not use it for
releases the bot can race.

## Step 6. Verify binary: URLs resolve

The recipe `binary:` uses `%v` which F-Droid resolves to the versionName. Resolve
it manually and HEAD-check each URL:

```bash
for abi in armeabi-v7a arm64-v8a x86_64; do
  curl -sIL "https://github.com/RisorseArtificiali/anti-vocale/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/app-fdroid-${abi}-release.apk" \
    | grep -E '^HTTP|^location' | tail -1
done
```

Proof: all three return HTTP 200 (after redirect).

One command covers this plus two more gates:
`scripts/verify-github-workflow-before-recipe-push.sh vX.Y.Z` also requires
the reproducible job to have SUCCEEDED (not just finished) and the fork and
mirror recipes to be identical. It exists because on 2026-08-31 the recipe was
pushed while the reference build was still running, and the fdroiddata
pipeline failed on 404 binary URLs; run it before every recipe push, after
Step 5b completes (the release must exist by then; in build-first order it
does, created by the publish act).

**Only after the gate passes, push the fork** (this is what triggers the
fdroiddata pipeline; until now the signed APKs were not there yet). The push
is NON-FF by design (the branch was reset onto fdroid/master at Step 4), so
use the lease, and never discard origin-side Builds content (a maintainer's
edits; the machine-managed CurrentVersion fields are exempt because the
generator regenerates them):

```bash
cd ~/data/repo/personal/fdroid-data
git push --force-with-lease origin anti-vocale-1.10.0   # the current recipe branch (see Prerequisites)
# A pre-push hook in this checkout (scripts/fdroid-recipe-pre-push.sh in the
# app repo) blocks any push of the recipe branch until the signed APK URLs
# resolve, so the premature-push class cannot recur even by hand.
```

One command chains the whole post-build half: this gate, the fork push (only
if local recipe commits are pending), and the Step 7 pipeline status:

```
scripts/release-fdroid-references.sh finalize vX.Y.Z
```

## Step 7. Verify F-Droid reproducibility pipeline

The fork push (Step 6) triggered the fdroiddata pipeline in the fork project.
Poll it by recipe branch AND the fork SHA you pushed (a branch-only poll on
the long-lived recipe branch would return the PREVIOUS release's pipeline;
the `!43599` endpoint this step used until 2026-08-31 kept answering with a
merged 1.8.2-era green). `finalize` does this exact poll:

```bash
scripts/release-fdroid-references.sh finalize vX.Y.Z
# manual equivalent: GitLab API pipelines?ref=<recipe branch>&sha=<fork SHA>
```

Proof: GitLab pipeline `success`; the build is marked "verified reproducible".

## Step 8. Play Store (independent of F-Droid timing)

Trigger the Play Store publish job (AAB), or upload manually. This can run in
parallel with the F-Droid MR review; it does not block on it.

Proof: Play Console shows the new release in review/published.

## Post-release

- Update `project_play_store_release.md` memory with any new gotchas.
- Keep the F-Droid MR polling cron active until merge.
- If reproducibility fails: do NOT stack workarounds. Diff the built vs reference
  APK (`apksigcopier`, `unzip -l` diff) to find the nondeterministic element.

## Preflight and verify gates (TASK-335, added after v1.10.0)

One command before the pre-tag dispatch and again before publishing:

```bash
scripts/release-preflight.sh --tag vX.Y.Z --commit $SHA   # --commit: build-first (no tag yet); add --offline to skip network checks
# The preflight checks that .sherpa-version, fetch-sherpa-aar.sh, and the
# build.gradle.kts SRCLIB PIN comment are in sync, and that the fork recipe's
# srclib pin matches the commit in .sherpa-version. --commit makes the
# recipe-commit check run against the bump SHA instead of a tag that does not
# exist yet (without it, preflight fails spuriously in build-first order).
scripts/release-verify.sh vX.Y.Z            # after the publish act completes
```

The preflight encodes every failure mode of the v1.10.0 release day:
version-code derivation and the `?: N` fallback literal; Play release notes
within the 500-char limit (the extractor fails the build on over-length since
74aa4f2); fastlane changelogs present and within 500 chars (F-Droid limit);
the sherpa AAR on disk matching the fetch-script version and upstream size;
the fork recipe's newest Builds entry pointing at the tag commit with the
right vercodes and CurrentVersionCode; and, critically, the recipe's sherpa
srclib pin matching the sherpa tag of the AAR version (a stale pin builds the
F-Droid APK with a different native stack than every other artifact). Since
2026-08-31 it also verifies every recipe `ndk:` pin has an exact-version entry
in the reference workflow's NDK preinstall map (that day the 1.11.0 blocks
moved to r28c while the workflow preinstalled only r27c: fdroidserver cannot
download NDKs in that container, and the reference build died ~40 min in).

## Dispatch semantics and hard rules (v1.10.0 + 1.10.0-final lessons)

- **The mirror is the #1 drift source** (2026-08-21: three reference failures traced to it).
  Before ANY `workflow_dispatch` of the reproducible job: `diff` the mirror's recipe
  (github.com/paoloantinori/fdroid-data-mirror, branch `av1100-slim`) against the live
  fdroiddata MR HEAD for the app. The workflow guard will fail loudly on drift, but
  checking first saves a 45-minute build cycle.
- **Never `[ci skip]` on fdroiddata MRs**: their runners allow 4h; skipping blocks the
  maintainers' verification (learned 2026-08-21).
- **The reproducible job's guard is the last line of defense**: it fails the build
  unless every versionCode of the newest recipe block exists, its embedded
  versionCode matches, AND its embedded git revision equals the recipe's commit.
  A red guard is never "retry it": read the error, it names the exact drift.
- **fdroiddata uses ONE build block per versionCode sharing the versionName**:
  "the newest version" = all blocks whose versionName equals the last one.
- **Fastlane screenshot deletions do not propagate** to the F-Droid repo; same-name
  overwrites do. To retire a bad screenshot, replace it (commit a clean file under
  the same name), never just delete it upstream.

- `workflow_dispatch` with `-f tag=` checks out THE TAG COMMIT: anything fixed
  on main after tagging (notes, scripts, recipe couplings) does not reach that
  artifact. Fix-forward on main and dispatch WITHOUT the tag when the artifact
  content itself must include post-tag changes (same versionCode is fine for
  builds; see the next rule for uploads).
- Play rejects re-uploading an already-uploaded versionCode. Fix release notes
  by pasting them in the console; do not re-dispatch with `play-store-track`
  for the same code. internal is the deliberate default so promotion to
  production stays a human console decision.
- NEVER `gh release upload --clobber` on the canonical `app-fdroid-<abi>-release.apk`
  names: they are the F-Droid reproducibility references. Interim builds must
  be copied to a distinct filename before upload.
- The release-event run stays red (release-sanity) while the signing job is
  still building; the green record is the completed dispatch run. A red sanity
  with all three signed URLs resolving is the expected intermediate state.

## Play Console manual checklist (per release)

1. What's new: verify the <=500-char texts (or paste them if the upload
   predates a notes fix).
2. Advertising ID declaration (Policy, App content): answer NO. The app ships
   no AD_ID permission by design; the console warning about zeroed IDs is
   expected and correct for a no-tracking app.
3. Native debug symbols warning: advisory; a symbols zip from stripped
   prebuilt sherpa libs has limited value, skip unless native crashes need
   analysis.
4. Promote internal -> production; Google's review approval is the last gate.
