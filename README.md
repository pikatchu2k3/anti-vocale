# Anti-Vocale

Android app for transcribing voice messages locally on-device, with no internet required.

Anti-Vocale receives shared audio files (from WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.), transcribes them using on-device ASR models, and delivers the result via notification with one-tap copy and share-back actions.

It works on recorded calls and meetings too, at any length: recordings beyond a model's limit are split and stitched automatically (up to two hours on the streaming path), a failed long run keeps the transcript it already produced, and results export as subtitles (SRT, VTT) or timestamped text. An optional speaker-labels setting marks who said what in a conversation, rendering SPEAKER turns in results and exports.

## Why this app exists

The big messengers transcribe voice messages only partially, or not at all:

- **WhatsApp on Android** officially transcribes just English, Portuguese, Spanish, and Russian. Italian is supported on iPhone but is not supported on Android.
- **Telegram** runs transcription on its own servers and reserves it for paid Premium subscribers; free accounts get at most a small weekly trial quota that Telegram itself can dial down to nothing.
- **Signal** ships no voice transcription at all.

Anti-Vocale closes that gap with a different trade-off. It runs entirely on your phone, so audio never leaves the device, whatever chat it came from. Any messaging app can share into it through the standard Android share sheet, and you can also pick an audio or video file straight from storage inside the app. It is free. And it transcribes any language the installed models cover, including community fine-tunes imported from the model catalog, so coverage is not decided by a platform vendor.

## How this project is built

Anti-Vocale is developed with heavy AI assistance and human ownership: a coding agent executes, the maintainer designs, reviews, and owns every change, and one human signs every release. The badge above says it plainly and links here: AI-assisted, human-owned (blue = AI-assisted in the open [AI disclosure badge](https://disclosingai.com) convention).

This is a deliberate choice, not a shortcut. The compatibility space this app lives in is a matrix of devices, inference backends, models, and per-language quality, and it is too vast to validate the way a narrower domain could. Published WER numbers almost never match real-phone experience: they are typically measured on full-precision models running on desktops, before quantization and before vendor-specific Android quirks. That complexity is exactly why the project is only sustainable with heavy AI-assisted development plus feedback from the community on real devices.

What keeps that honest is the verification bar: every code change passes the automated test suite, and behavior changes are verified on a real device before release; the measurements and device logs behind the fixes are public in the issues. Much of the day-to-day development happens over chat from a phone, sometimes while walking down the street: decisions land where life happens, and the verification pipeline is what makes that safe. If you want to contribute, [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) says what we ask of AI-assisted contributions.

## Model catalog

Everything the app can transcribe with, on one page: bundled models with sizes, languages, speed notes, and the community imports, each linked back to the original model it comes from. See [docs/model-catalog.md](docs/model-catalog.md).

## Features

### Privacy & offline first

- **Fully offline** - All processing happens on-device, no data leaves your phone
- **Local history** - Every transcription is saved to an on-device database with full-text search; nothing is uploaded

### Models

- **Multiple ASR engines** - Choose between Gemma (LLM), Whisper, Parakeet TDT, Qwen3-ASR, GigaAM v3, Nemotron 3.5 (streaming), or import your own
- **Custom model import** - Bring any sherpa-onnx model (transducer, Whisper, CTC, SenseVoice, Canary, Moonshine, Dolphin) from a folder or HuggingFace URL, no app update needed; one-tap validated entries live in the community catalog, and only models matching a supported family's layout import ([docs](docs/external-models.md#what-import-is-for-and-what-it-does-not-promise))
- **Full user manual** - Getting started, choosing a model, troubleshooting and FAQ, in 8 languages ([user guide](docs/user-guide/))
- **Any audio length** - Long inputs are automatically split and stitched; practical ceilings are declared up front (2 hours on the streaming path, memory-dependent with VAD enabled) (see the [FAQ](FAQ.md))
- **Declared limits before download** - Each model card states its audio-length capability up front, so big downloads are informed choices
- **Model benchmarking** - Compare real-world transcription speed between models on your own device

### Transcription pipeline

- **Queue-aware processing** - Concurrent requests queue up visibly (Queued → Processing → Done) and complete in order
- **Progressive display** - Text appears segment-by-segment instead of waiting for the full result
- **VAD silence stripping** - Optionally strip silent segments before transcription for faster results (boundaries fall on natural speech gaps)
- **Confidence indicator** - Shows detected language and warns about low-confidence results
- **Video file support** - Transcribe audio from video files; extract embedded subtitles
- **Summaries** - With a Gemma model installed, long transcripts get an optional short recap (and a punctuation polish pass), opt-in from Settings
- **Speaker labels** - Optional per-sentence speaker attribution in conversations, rendered as SPEAKER turns in the result and every export
- **Calibration-based ETA** - Progress estimates improve as the model adapts to your device

### Results & history

- **Smart notifications** - Read long transcripts page-by-page without leaving the shade, copy the full result, or send it back to the source app with one tap
- **Re-transcribe** - Retry any transcription with a different model straight from the history
- **History actions** - Swipe or long-press any entry for copy, re-transcribe, and delete
- **Per-entry metadata** - Each entry shows which model produced it and how long it took
- **Auto-copy** - Optionally copy transcription to clipboard automatically
- **Save to folder** - Auto-save transcripts as .txt to a folder of your choice (Drive, Syncthing, Dropbox, etc.)
- **Picture-in-Picture** - See live transcription in a floating window while using other apps

### Integration & automation

- **Share integration** - Share audio from any messaging app to transcribe
- **Direct file picker** - Pick any audio or video file from storage in the app, no messaging app needed
- **Model-specific share targets** - Pick a specific model directly from the Android share sheet
- **Tasker/automation support** - Trigger transcription via broadcast intents
- **HuggingFace login** - Authenticate (token or OAuth) for gated model downloads

### Performance & appearance

- **Configurable inference threads** - Auto-detects or manually sets thread count; NNAPI and CPU providers selectable
- **Performance stats** - Track real-world transcription speed per model on your device
- **Theming** - Three color palettes (Indigo, WhatsApp, Telegram) with light and dark modes
- **Multilingual UI** - Interface translated in English, Italian, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Polish, Portuguese (BR), Russian, Turkish, and Ukrainian
- **Per-app settings** - Configure notification behavior per messaging app
- **Organized settings** - Grouped into Transcription, Appearance, and Advanced sections

Import any sherpa-onnx model (transducer, Whisper, CTC, SenseVoice, Canary, Moonshine, Dolphin) from a local folder or HuggingFace URL, or take the recommended route: the community catalog offers validated models as a one-tap import, per language. The app handles role-based file matching, SHA-256 verification, and architecture selection. See the [import reference](docs/external-models.md) for supported formats, the catalog-entry JSON schema, and [what import can and cannot do](docs/external-models.md#what-import-is-for-and-what-it-does-not-promise).

### Italian ASR Benchmark

[Full 4-model comparison](scripts/benchmark/README.md) on 8 Italian FLEURS samples (101.6s audio):

| Model | WER | Speed | Size |
|-------|-----|-------|------|
| **Distil Large V3 IT** | **4.3%** | 0.723x | 939MB |

## Automation

Anti-Vocale can be triggered via broadcast intents for use with Tasker or other automation tools. Both automation receivers are **off by default**: enable them once under **Settings > Advanced > External automation (Tasker)**, or every request is rejected with a notice pointing there.

```bash
# Transcribe an audio file
adb shell am broadcast \
  -n com.antivocale.app/.receiver.TaskerRequestReceiver \
  -a com.antivocale.app.PROCESS_REQUEST \
  --es request_type "audio" \
  --es file_path "<app-readable path>" \
  --es task_id "transcribe_$(date +%s)"

# Preload model into memory
adb shell am broadcast -a com.antivocale.app.PRELOAD_MODEL
```

The app holds no storage permissions, so shared-storage paths like `/sdcard/Download` are NOT readable by it. Pass a path inside the app's own storage instead; how Tasker setups stage files is covered in the guide.

See [docs/TASKER_GUIDE.md](docs/TASKER_GUIDE.md) for detailed automation setup.
