/**
 * TASK-513 (GH #93): detects the model family from the candidate file names,
 * so a manual import can prefill the family instead of failing with a
 * transducer-shaped validation error.
 *
 * Detection probes every family's own copy plan against the candidate set:
 * the plan (the same single role table the import validates with) succeeds
 * exactly when that family can consume the set. A set matching several plans
 * (Whisper and Canary share their file shape) comes back [Result.Ambiguous];
 * the caller narrows it with filename/URL hints ([narrow]) or asks the user.
 * One shape is genuinely two families: model.onnx + tokens.txt fits both CTC
 * and SenseVoice, so that pair always comes back Ambiguous (the model.onnx
 * metadata is the only true discriminator, read later by the importer).
 * The transducer plan's mismatch guard throws when a transducer-shaped set
 * reaches another family; that throw is caught and treated as non-candidate.
