/**
 * TASK-672 (GH #72): the deterministic tier-1 hallucination-loop
 * collapse, ported from the maintainer's Omnivoice reference
 * (backend/services/refinement.py). Pure Kotlin, no Android imports, so
 * the whole pass is JVM-testable.
 *
 * A looping decoder emits one unit until its budget fills ("url url
 * url url..." or "thanks for watching thanks for watching..."), the
 * transcript class that once crashed the History list (TASK-506) and
 * that [RepetitionLoopDetector] only warns about. This pass rewrites
 * the loop down instead: two regex tiers, word runs first, then a
 * character-level pass for multi-word loops and no-space-script loops.
 * Both tiers need the unit to repeat [REPETITION_RUN_THRESHOLD] times
 * consecutively, so rhetorical repetition survives (anaphora, counted
 * lists, choruses at five repeats or fewer), and the repeating unit is
 * bounded at [MAX_REPETITION_UNIT_CHARS] so a long legitimate sentence
 * can never pair with itself as a "unit". No LLM anywhere in this
 * tier; the constants are the guard.
