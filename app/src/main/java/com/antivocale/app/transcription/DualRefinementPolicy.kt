 * GH #43 (design D3): the one eligibility gate for two-pass transcription
 * (fast streaming first pass + accurate refinement). Pure on purpose: the
 * call site supplies resolved facts, so a duration or calibration-based
 * threshold can be added after the device trial without touching call sites.
 *
 * All conditions must hold; otherwise the request runs single-model exactly
 * as today. The gate returns the chosen fast backend id so the caller never
 * re-derives it.
